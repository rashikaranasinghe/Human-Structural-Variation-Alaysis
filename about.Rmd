### Overview

This website presents a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the **largest known inversion in the human genome**-**chromosome 8p23.1** (approximately 4.5 Mb).  

The analysis shown in this site includes:

- Extracting genes located within the inversion region using **Ensembl (biomaRt)**  
- Visualizing gene positions along the inverted genomic segment  
- Performing GO enrichment using **clusterProfiler**  
- Generating visual summaries of functional categories (BP, CC, MF)  
- Displaying network-level connections among enriched pathways  

This work is intended as a concise, reproducible demonstration of functional enrichment analysis for structural variant–associated gene sets.

### Background: 8p23.1 Inversion

The 8p23.1 inversion spans over 4 Mb and is found in many global human populations.  
It is a **paracentric inversion**, meaning it does not include the centromere.  
This region contains several gene families of biological interest.

Understanding functional patterns within this inversion helps identify potential adaptive, developmental, and regulatory features associated with its evolutionary history.

### Methods Summary

The workflow used on this site:

1. **Define inversion coordinates**  
2. **Retrieve genes from Ensembl**  
3. **Visualize gene structure with gggenes and Gviz**  
4. **Convert gene IDs to ENTREZ IDs**  
5. **Run GO enrichment (BP, CC, MF)**  
6. **Generate bar plots, dot plots, and network graphs**

These steps provide a reproducible pipeline for functional annotation of structural variant regions.
